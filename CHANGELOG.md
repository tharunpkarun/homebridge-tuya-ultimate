# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed
 - Renamed the user-facing plugin title from Homebridge Tuya Ultimate to Tuya Ultimate.

## [2.6.0] - (2026.7.26)

### Added
 - Smart Life and Tuya Smart QR account authorization without per-user Tuya IoT developer credentials.
 - Encrypted Tuya device-sharing API transport, token renewal, account MQTT, raw datapoint conversion strategies, scenes, and Config UI onboarding.
 - Account devices are normalized into the existing official accessory factory, preserving its category handlers and device overrides.

### Changed
 - Updated the MQTT and UUID runtime dependencies to versions with no known production audit findings.

### Fixed
 - Map `infrared_ac` virtual remotes to the thermostat-style IR air-conditioner accessory instead of generic IR button switches.
 - Build the runtime automatically when the plugin is installed directly from GitHub.
 - Store QR credentials where both the custom UI and Homebridge runtime can access them, with automatic migration from the earlier UI location.

### Security
 - Account tokens are kept outside `config.json` in a `0600` persist file and are renewed atomically.
 - Compatibility mode uses Home Assistant's public Tuya client ID and QR schema by default, with an explicit coexistence warning and optional identity overrides.

## [2.5.1] - (2026.7.22)

### Fixed
 - Resolved security issues detected by npm audit by applying automated fixes with npm audit fix.
   - node_modules/brace-expansion v1.1.15 -> v1.1.16
   - node_modules/js-yaml v4.2.0 -> 4.3.0
   - node_modules/rimraf/node_modules/brace-expansion v5.0.6 -> 5.0.7
   - node_modules/tar v7.5.16 -> 7.5.21


## [2.5.0] - (2026.7.12)

### Added
 - RTSP cameras can now be added through the plugin’s “Advanced Settings” section.
 
## [2.4.0] - (2026.7.4)

### Fixed
 - fixed the WBGT calculation
 
### Changed
 - Added additional supported product types for AirConditionerAccessory
 

## [2.3.0] - (2026.6.12)

### Added
 - Added an option to force communication over IPv4.
 - Added contact sensor state option for garage doors

### Changed
 - Updated the behavior so that sensitive data is not logged unless debugMode is enabled.


## [2.2.3] - (2026.5.8)

### Changed
 - Updated so that switch names are not sanitized when the plugin restarts.
This prevents the plugin from unnecessarily updating the name set by the user in the Home app.
Since information from the Home app is not sent to the plugin, I recommend changing device names through the plugin settings to avoid unintended name updates.
 - Fixed an issue where switch names were not being sanitized for devices that contain multiple switches.
This will suppress the Homebridge warning logs.

## [2.2.2] - (2026.4.8)

### Fixed
 - Fix an issue where the Configured Name was sometimes not applied

## [2.2.1] - (2026.3.9)

### Fixed
 - Homebridge V2: supported.
 - Accessory names containing invalid characters are now automatically sanitized to be HomeKit-compliant. This prevents the "invalid  'ConfiguredName'" warning and reduces the risk of accessories failing to be added or becoming unresponsive in the Home app.
 - Logging added to show when names are corrected.

## [2.2.0] - (2026.2.23)

### Fixed
 - Fixed the HeaterAccessory to follow the device’s schema information.
If you want to revert to the previous behavior, set the category code to qn_old. 

### Changed
 - Updated the handling of DP Codes so they are now processed in a case‑insensitive manner.
 - Updated the plugin settings window to mask the password field.

## [2.1.0] - (2026.1.5)

### Added
 - Support Towel Rack(mjj)
The implementation is almost identical to a thermostat.
The difference is that there is no limit on the set temperature.
The lower limit, upper limit, and step of the set temperature may sometimes differ from expectations. Since this is an issue with the product you are using, please override it to any desired value in Advanced Options.

## [2.0.3] - (2025.9.6)

First release after forking.
Homebridge verified.

### Added
 - Added an illuminance sensor to the IRControlHub.
 - Added an accessory that displays weather temperature and humidity.
 - config.schema.json to allow customizing the Service information for each accessory.

### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue where learned infrared codes in the IRControlHub would not work in some cases. This likely improves compatibility with older devices.
### Changed
 - Updated the IRControlHub to calculate WBGT based on its temperature and humidity readings and expose it as an accessory.
 - Updated the Outlet accessory so that its “in use” status can be checked in the Home app.
